# Data-Mining-Course

Both projects done using python Jupyter Notebook,so more information can be seen inside the .ipynb files.

Project1:

Classification of large number of tweets through sentiment analysis(Positive,Negative,Neutral).
Preprossecing using Sklearn-nltk(tokenization,stemming-lemmatizing,stopword removal).
Vectorization:TF-IDF,Bag of Words and Word Embeddings model using my trained
Word2Vec gensim model.Dimensionality reduction using SVD for better results. Clas-
sification:KNN,SVM(Supporting Vector Machines) and evaluation using f1-score and
confusion-matrix.

Project2:

Data Analysis on a given dataset of the crimes in Boston during 2012-2017.Extracting
some conclusions(e.g. the region where the most shootings have been commited) and
showing them using Seaborn(countplot).Clustering with K-Means(for various k-values)
and visualization of the results using matplotlib scatterplot.
